    "## Raw GNSS data\n",
    "In this lab we will not work with the raw GNSS data; this is because GNSS data for tectonic purposes is usually processed as a *network*, meaning a group of stations are processed all at once to obtain position information. This is different than what your phone or a typical GNSS receiver does, which is to estimate your position based on a single receiver. Network processing allows for much more precise positioning, because it allows the processing algorithm to solve for certain noise sources that are common to all stations and subtract it out. The image below shows an example of a Rinex file for GNSS station \"CAPO\" located in Haiti using a Trimble-brand GNSS receiver.\n",

    "## GNSS time-series\n",
    "Most GNSS applications, including the earth sciences, use position time-series. The plot below shows an example time-series for station (P595) in California, near where the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake occurred. The time-series shows the point location relative to the initial starting point for each day. GNSS records data continously, but the data are typically averaged to one position per day to reduce noise. The time-series provides several types of useful information. First, the points change at a fairly constant rate; in the plot, you can see that the position of the GNSS station moves west (negative east) at a rate of approximately 7 mm/yr, and north at approximately 10 mm/yr. The data shows a fairly constant rate of change until an event, which in this case is the Ridgecrest earthquake. You also see that the vertical motion is much noisier and has\n",
    "a much lower rate (the slope of the average trend is small).\n",
